# Singapura Travel

This is a new company website based in Singapore that caters for first time travellers. The aim of the site is to for travellers to purchase packages that tick off essential sights and activities.

## User Experience
* I want users to create an account.
* I want users can edit, delete and add comments on the blog and packages.
* The incentive for registered users is 10% off a package price.

* Features to implement
1. Adding the functionality to add images to the site so that users' images can be shared on social media such as Instagram.
2. Create a forum where users can meet to discuss travel to Singapore and could contribute ideas to new packages.
